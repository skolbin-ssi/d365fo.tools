If you have never worked with GitHub/Git it can be challenging to know where to begin. The purpose of this page is to just simply provide some good references (bookmarks) that can help you get started more quickly....and easily.

## Understanding the process/tools
[How to Github: Fork, Branch, Track, Squash and Pull Request](https://gun.io/blog/how-to-github-fork-branch-and-pull-request/)

[Contributing to Projects with GitHub Desktop](https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing/)

## Actually doing it
[Learning Git Branching](http://learngitbranching.js.org/) - Online lab of sorts for trying out and learning Git command line.

## Creating your first pull request
If you feel for fixing a bug, but don't know GitHub enough, the [dbatool.io](https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/dbatools) project has a good starting guide. We are on the same team, so instead of us writing a guide that is close to theirs - we simply point to theirs [step-by-step guide](https://dbatools.io/firstpull).

## Really cool tutorial site!
[git-scm](https://git-scm.com/)

**Note:** This entire page is deeply inspired by the work done over in the [dbatool.io](https://github.com/sqlcollaborative/dbatools) module. Pay them a visit and learn from the very same people as we did.
