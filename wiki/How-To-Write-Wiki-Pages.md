# Create gifs

To create gif files from a PowerShell cmdlet execution, you can use the following two programs to
- record the execution: [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/)
- fine tune the gif: [ScreenToGif](https://www.screentogif.com/)

After the initial gif has been recorded with ShareX, you can use ScreenToGif to strip out all the 100% identical images in the gif, add a custom wait time across all the images and duplicate the last image and set the wait for 1-3 seconds.

You can open one of the existing gifs in ScreenToGif to see what wait timeout is configured.
