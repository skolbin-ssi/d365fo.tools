    .SYNOPSIS
        Repair a bacpac model file - using qualification logic
        
    .DESCRIPTION
        Will use a search pattern, qualification and end pattern, to remove an element from the model file
        
    .PARAMETER Path
        Path to the bacpac model file that you want to work against
        
    .PARAMETER OutputPath
        Path to where the repaired model file should be placed
        
    .PARAMETER Search
        Search pattern that is used to start the removable of the element
        
        Supports wildcard - as it utilizes the -Like operation that is available directly in powershell
        
        E.g. "*<Element Type=\"SqlRoleMembership\">*"
        
    .PARAMETER Qualifier
        Qualifier pattern that is used to qualify the element, based on a nested line value
        
        Supports wildcard - as it utilizes the -Like operation that is available directly in powershell
        
        E.g. "*<References Name=*ms_db_configwriter*"
        
    .PARAMETER End
        End pattern that is used to conclude the removable of the element
        
        Supports wildcard - as it utilizes the -Like operation that is available directly in powershell
        
        E.g. "*</Element>*"
        
    .EXAMPLE
        PS C:\> Repair-BacpacModelQualifier -Path c:\temp\model.xml -OutputPath c:\temp\repaired_model.xml -Search '*<Element Type="SqlRoleMembership">*' -Qualifier "*<References Name=*ms_db_configwriter*" -End "*</Element>*"
        
        This will remove the below section from the model file
        
        <Element Type="SqlRoleMembership">
        <Relationship Name="Member">
        <Entry>
        <References Name="[ms_db_configwriter]" />
        </Entry>
        </Relationship>
        <Relationship Name="Role">
        <Entry>
        <References ExternalSource="BuiltIns" Name="[db_ddladmin]" />
        </Entry>
        </Relationship>
        </Element>

        Json files has to be an array directly in the root of the file. All " (double quotes) has to be escaped with \" - otherwise it will not work as intended.
